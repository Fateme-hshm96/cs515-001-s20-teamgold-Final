# CS515 Final Project
Mining and analyzing different open-source projects from various perspectives can result in interesting and helpful outcomes. There are several tools and APIs designed for these types of goals. 
In our project we want to use PyDriller framework to investigate some open-source projects on Github, targeting bug analysis and knowledge discovery.
The research question we seek answer for are as follow:
1. Are there any patterns for bugs in open source projects?
2. In which programming languages developers tend to write buggy codes more?
3. What proportion of bugs are removed before merging the branch into the master branch?
4. How long does it take between causing and resolving a bugs?
5. Does usually the same developer who caused the bug resolve that bug?
